              <h4>The challenge</h4>
              <p>Students and educators were having trouble collaborating on assignments with no effective method for reviewing, commenting and sharing a document.</p>

              <h4>Our approach</h4>
              <p>Through interviews, focus groups and feedback, we learned that teachers needed a way to easily upload or scan content, edit it, set permissions and restraints, and respond to student's comments.</p>

              <h4>Breathable design, logical organization</h4>
              <p>Since potentially hundreds of students would be annotating the same document, we made design decisions that would keep information orderly and uncluttered.</p>
              <p>Editable areas of the app expand naturally to fill the available viewport and provide the best possible writing experience.</p>

              <p>The platform was built using Python, Angular, HTML5, CSS, Terraform, Tesseract OCR and a few more magic things.</p>
              <p>We built a custom platform to integrate advanced document management with OCR processing and multi-threaded annotations.</p>

              <h4>The outcome</h4>
              <p>The finished Digital Gateway allows students and educators to effectively collaborate on annotation-based assignments.</p>
              <p>Widely accepted and appreciated by faculty, staff and over 600 students, we are continuing to work with the University to customize similar solutions to fit other departments' needs.</p>
              <p>We loved working on this project and are excited to be a part of its future moving forward.</p>
