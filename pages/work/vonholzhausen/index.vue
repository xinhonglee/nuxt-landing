                <h4>Something different</h4>
                <p>Vicki von Holzhausen's brand is a little unconventional. We used fresh thinking to produce a modern design that held up to her and her audience's expectations.</p>

                <h4>A fixed viewport</h4>
                <p>As most ecommerce sites tend to look and feel the same, we decided to change things up. Here, a fixed frame viewport features animated panels and interactive flyouts, such as the details link that folds outwards from the top right into a series of boxes showing price, size and color options.</p>

                <p>Since potentially hundreds of students would be annotating the same document, we made design decisions that would keep information orderly and uncluttered.</p>
                <p>Editable areas of the app expand naturally to fill the available viewport and provide the best possible writing experience.</p>

                <p>The platform was built using Python, Angular, HTML5, CSS, Terraform, Tesseract OCR and a few more magic things.</p>
                <p>We built a custom platform to integrate advanced document management with OCR processing and multi-threaded annotations.</p>

                <h4>The outcome</h4>
                <p>The finished Digital Gateway allows students and educators to effectively collaborate on annotation-based assignments.</p>
                <p>Widely accepted and appreciated by faculty, staff and over 600 students, we are continuing to work with the University to customize similar solutions to fit other departments' needs.</p>
                <p>We loved working on this project and are excited to be a part of its future moving forward.</p>
