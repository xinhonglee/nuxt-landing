        <p>A user profile offers a personalized experience that allows citizens to view information relevant to their neighborhood, upcoming events, service requests and site activity. They can easily view information such as trash collection days, favorite and nearby parks, local schools and libraries, polling places, and local representatives. They can also view service requests and messages sent to representatives, as well as the status of job applications and permits. This area also shows local weather, upcoming events and messages. Citizens can manage their email and SMS subscriptions and provide website feedback here as well. All of these features are dependent upon settings from the Admin profile within the CMS and can be adjusted as new features are offered.</p>
