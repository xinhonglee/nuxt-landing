        <p>We use MailChimp, the world's largest marketing automation platform for creating and managing newsletters. This tool is seamlessly integrated into the CMS, allowing you to schedule and send newsletters to lists segmented by categories you define. Once messages are sent, you can monitor opens, click-throughs and more, and receive custom reports via the CMS dashboard, email, or mobile app.</p>
