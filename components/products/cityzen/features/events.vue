        <p>One of the most used features of city websites is the events calendar. Our calendar allows events to be easily added on the backend, by filling out a form that includes all of the details necessary for the event, including photos and images. On the front end, your citizens can submit their own events which are approved by site admin. Also included is hassle free integration with Eventbrite for access to even more events.</p>
