        <p>Citizens can request public records via links on appropriate department pages, or within the Record Request section on the website through forms. Records can be automatically accessed via PDF where appropriate, and other requests can be automatically forwarded to the appropriate person or department who handles the requests, with the option to fax a copy of the request when necessary. Citizens are able to see their open record requests from their profile page, or have the option of having the record emailed or mailed if they do not wish to create a user profile.</p>
